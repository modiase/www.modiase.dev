      I am a keen naturalist and environmentalist and have spent the last few years working in
      cleantech and believe that an
      <strong>abundant but sustainable future is possible.</strong>. I have recently refocused my
      time on learning more about AI and how it can be used to usher in a
      <strong>new era of human and environmental flourishing.</strong>
